# Epicenter Component-System Collapse

This reference owns the smell and ownership decisions that collapse app-local
UI into the shared product system. For the exact component catalog, import
boundary, loading and empty-state guidance, tooltip API, composition ladder,
vendored-fork differences, and update workflow, read the authoritative
[`packages/ui/README.md`](../../../../packages/ui/README.md). Do not copy that
package guide into this reference.

## Collapse Smells

These are high-signal smells, not automatic bans:

- Arbitrary Tailwind values such as `text-[11px]`, `rounded-[7px]`,
  `max-w-[43rem]`, or other exact values outside the shared scale.
- Raw hex, RGB, or palette colors where a semantic token should own the role.
- Stray `div` wrappers whose only job is carrying layout or visual classes.
- Long class bundles that restyle a primitive's spacing, density, radius,
  typography, hover, focus, shadow, or transition budget.
- Local loading, empty, error, confirmation, tooltip, or command markup that a
  shared component already owns.
- The same visual bundle copied across screens or apps.
- One-off responsive branches, hover treatments, or animations preserved only
  to reproduce the old screen exactly.

For each smell, name the user-visible objective and compare the code with the
natural component-system composition. If the objective survives without the
custom detail, delete the detail and its wrappers instead of translating them
line for line.

An arbitrary value or custom color can survive when it owns precise geometry,
data visualization, a third-party integration constraint, or another concrete
product reason that the shared scale cannot express. Name the reason. If the
value repeats or becomes a reusable visual decision, promote it to a semantic
token, component variant, or stable primitive.

## What Earns A Custom Shape

Keep a composition in the app when it owns app-specific data, persistence,
policy, workflow, or product meaning. Its styling should still compose shared
primitives rather than rebuilding them.

Move a shape into `packages/ui` when it is stable and visual and either:

- several apps need the same product concept; or
- it owns an accessibility or interaction contract that should not be
  reimplemented locally.

Do not promote speculative reuse. Do not keep a reusable visual contract local
merely because the first consumer happened to live in one app.

When a shape moves into `packages/ui`, follow the package guide instead of
inventing a parallel import, variant, overlay, or vendoring rule. Run
`bun run check:ui-boundary` after changing package imports or app configuration.
