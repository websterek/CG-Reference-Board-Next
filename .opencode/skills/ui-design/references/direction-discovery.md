# Direction Discovery

Use this reference when a rough UI request has not yet converged on one
buildable direction. This is not a visual polish pass. It decides what the
surface is for, which category pattern it should borrow or refuse, and what
proof is needed before implementation is done.

## Design Brief

Start with the smallest useful brief:

```txt
Surface:
  What screen, component, or flow is changing?

User job:
  What is the user trying to get done?

Category:
  Which comparable product category should this feel like?

Constraint:
  What must stay true in this repo, app, or design system?
```

If the request is vague but implementation can still move, state the assumption
and continue. Ask a question only when its answer would change the surface or
data model.

## Design Pass

1. Write a one-sentence thesis for the screen.
2. When category fit is load-bearing, read
   [comparable-apps.md](comparable-apps.md) and name the pattern being borrowed
   or refused.
3. Choose one primary direction. When uncertainty is visual rather than verbal,
   use [prototype](../../prototype/SKILL.md) to create two or three throwaway
   variants before choosing.
4. Translate the direction into concrete controls, states, density, layout, and
   copy.
5. Return to the parent `ui-design` workflow for implementation and browser
   verification.

## Output Shape

```txt
Thesis:
  One sentence.

Comparisons:
  App or surface | Pattern | Borrow or refuse

Direction:
  The chosen design and why it fits Epicenter.

Implementation:
  Files or surfaces that need to change.
```

Keep Epicenter workspace-first. Prefer dense, quiet, operational UI for tools.
Do not stop at mood words: every direction must map to layout, controls, states,
and verification. Do not prototype when the existing surface already answers
the question.
