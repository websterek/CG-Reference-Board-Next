# UI Pre-Flight

Pre-flight is the final shippability check before handoff or commit. It is not a
design phase. Run it after the UI direction and implementation are in place.

Report only failures, intentional exceptions, or checks that materially changed
the implementation.

## Light Pre-Flight

Run this for any visible UI change:

```txt
Foundation:
  Uses @epicenter/ui primitives where appropriate.
  Does not import from packages/ui/src or stock $lib/components/ui paths.
  Does not create a one-off primitive when a local one exists.
  Does not preserve inherited markup or styling merely for exact reproduction.

Collapse:
  No class-heavy wrapper survives when a primitive can own the composition.
  Arbitrary values and custom colors have a named product or geometry reason.
  Primitive overrides express parent layout or product state, not a second theme.
  Surviving app-local UI owns app-specific behavior or product meaning.

States:
  Loading, empty, error, disabled, selected, and pending states are considered.
  Async actions keep useful labels or context.

Accessibility:
  Text and controls have sufficient contrast.
  Focus states are visible.
  Icon-only controls have labels or tooltips.
  Clickable rows or custom controls have keyboard behavior.

Layout:
  Responsive behavior is not obviously broken.
  Scroll regions have a clear height boundary.
  No unnecessary wrapper exists only to carry classes.

Copy and visuals:
  Visible strings are reread.
  No obvious filler copy, fake precision, or generic placeholder names ship.
  The user-visible objective survives even when inherited structure does not.
```

## Full Pre-Flight

Run this for new surfaces, redesigns, explicit polish requests, dashboards,
marketing pages, docs home pages, and playful or interactive public surfaces:

```txt
Design read:
  The output matches the stated surface, audience, posture, and density.

System coherence:
  One component foundation.
  One palette and accent logic.
  One radius, shadow, and border language, or a named rule for variants.
  Typography matches the surface and does not rely on random font contrast.
  Repeated visual contracts are promoted instead of copied locally.

Hierarchy and density:
  The primary action or reading path is obvious.
  Dense screens scan cleanly.
  Marketing or docs pages have rhythm without repeating the same section pattern.

State quality:
  Loading, empty, error, disabled, pending, selected, and filter-empty states are designed.
  No UI affordance implies an unavailable or impossible state.

Motion:
  Motion has a reason: hierarchy, storytelling, feedback, or state transition.
  Reduced-motion behavior is safe.
  Page/view transitions do not hide state or interrupt fast app use.

Responsive behavior:
  Multi-column or high-variance layouts have explicit mobile collapse.
  Navigation fits the target viewport.
  CTAs and important controls do not wrap into broken shapes.

Content:
  Copy is specific and natural.
  Numbers are real or clearly illustrative.
  Logo walls, testimonials, and examples do not use generic filler.

Implementation fit:
  @epicenter/ui owns primitives.
  styling owns Tailwind/CSS mechanics.
  svelte owns component lifecycle and state mechanics.
  tanstack-table owns table state when tables are involved.
```

## Exceptions

A failed check can ship only when the exception is intentional and named:

```txt
Pre-flight exception:
  <check> is intentionally skipped because <reason>.
```

Do not add hidden compatibility UI or one-off components to satisfy the checklist.
Fix the design, narrow the scope, or report the exception.
